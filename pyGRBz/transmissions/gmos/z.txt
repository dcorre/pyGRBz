# GMOS-N transmission curve for z' filter
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) transmission.
# These are the 'new' flatter filters from Barr.
# Data are taken from faxes sent to Jeremy Allington-Smith, 
# and read from plots by Isobel Hook 29 Jan 2001.

# There are two of each color filter, the transmission curve here
# is for set two - to be delivered with GMOS-N.
# Start wavelength point is added as 0.00 for extrapolation.
